* ej helps you work with Erlang terms representing JSON

The ej module is intended to make it easier to work with the Erlang
structure returned by =mochijson2:decode/1= to represent JSON as
Erlang terms.  You can use =ej:get= to walk an object and return a
particular value, or =ej:set= to update a value within an object.

The idea for this helper module was inspired by [[http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-programming/browse_thread/thread/7af6f99e740df979/97c50c0df25502cd?lnk=gst&q=Javascript+parse+transform#97c50c0df25502cd][this thread on the
Erlang Questions]] mailing list and, in particular, by the reply from
Richard O'Keefe.  Additional motivation from the very similar helper
module =struct= included in the [[http://beebole.com/en/blog/erlang/tutorial-web-application-erlang/][sticky notes example application]] from
the folks at BeeBole.
